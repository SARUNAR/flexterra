1. Install Terraform
Download terraform depending on your system. Installation is very simple. Download the terraform zip archive and unzip it in a suitable location. Once we have unzipped the terraform, update PATH environment variable pointing to terraform. Since the folder /usr/local/bin is already set to PATH environment variable, we donâ€™t need to set it again. If you are using any other location, then specify it in the PATH environment variable either in .bash_profile or in /etc/profile.
$ wget https://releases.hashicorp.com/terraform/0.10.7/terraform_0.10.7_linux_386.zip
$ unzip terraform_0.10.7_linux_386.zip
$ mv terraform /usr/local/bin/
$ export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/bin/
Check the installation: 
$ terraform -v
--If you want the latest version just change the 0.10.7 to 0.10.9 corresponding version number
